# About me

My name is Geraldine Klarenberg. I am a Data Scientist with extensive experience in statistics, analysis methods, teaching, collaborating on multi-disciplinary teams, and systems thinking. My main expertise is in natural resources (e.g. hydrology, water quality, agriculture, fisheries, wildlife, forestry) but I have and continue to work with a vast array of datasets, including those related to social sciences, health, and epidemiology.  

I have a Master's degree in Irrigation and Water Engineering (Tropical Landuse) from Wageningen University (The Netherlands) and a PhD in Agricultural and Biological Engineering from the University of Florida (USA).

Before I went back to graduate school for my PhD, I was a project manager and policy analyst for South Africa's largest water and sanitation non-profit The Mvula Trust.
